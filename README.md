## Problem to be Solved

The goal of this project is to cluster customers into distinct groups based on demographic and behavioral attributes. By doing so, we aim to uncover patterns and segments within the customer base that can inform marketing strategies and business decisions.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used for this analysis, contains the following features:

* Custumer ID: Identification of customer
* Gender: Male or Female
* Age: Age of the customer
* Annual Income (k$): Annual income in thousands of dollars
* Spending Score (1-100): Score reflecting customer spending behavior

## Steps followed 

### [1]  Data Loading and Exploration:

* Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure and variables.
* Explored basic statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of features.

### [2]  Data Preprocessing:

* Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
* Converted categorical variables into numerical format for modeling purposes.

### [3]  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Conducted EDA to gain insights into the relationships between variables.
* Visualized distributions, and key trends using plots and summary statistics.

### [4]  Model Selection and Training:

* Selected multiple clustering algorithms: KMeans, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering.
* Trained each model and evaluated their performance using metrics such as Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.

### [5]  Cluster Analysis:

* Interpreted and analyzed the clusters generated by the KMeans model, which showed the best performance.
* Described each cluster based on its demographic and behavioral characteristics.

### [6]  Insights and Conclusions:

* Identified distinct customer segments with unique attributes, such as age, income, and spending behavior.
* Provided actionable insights for marketing strategies tailored to each customer segment.

## Insights

Based on the KMeans model, the clustered data reveals the following distinct customer segments:

* Cluster 0: primarily consists of older females with an average age of 45 years. They tend to have a lower income, averaging 26,304, and exhibit low spending behavior with an average spending score of 20.91.
* Cluster 1: is characterized by a balanced gender ratio, slightly more female, with a younger age group averaging 32 years. This cluster has a high income, averaging 86,538, and high spending behavior, with an average spending score of 82.13.
* Cluster 2: also has a balanced gender ratio, slightly more male, and includes middle-aged individuals averaging 40 years. They have a high income of 87,432 but low spending behavior, with an average spending score of 18.19.
* Cluster 3: consists predominantly of older females with an average age of 43 years. They have a moderate income, averaging 54,823, and exhibit moderate spending behavior, with an average spending score of 49.84.
* Cluster 4: is characterized by predominantly young females, averaging 25 years. This cluster has a lower income, averaging 25,727, but shows high spending behavior with an average spending score of 79.36.

Based on these evaluations and the detailed cluster analysis, the KMeans model is recommended for clustering this dataset. KMeans effectively identifies distinct customer segments, which can be used to tailor marketing strategies, personalize customer experiences, and optimize resource allocation. The identified clusters provide valuable insights into the demographics, income levels, and spending behaviors of different customer groups, enabling data-driven decision-making for targeted marketing and customer relationship management.

## Conclusion

Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses aiming to optimize marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to uncover meaningful customer segments based on behavioral data. By leveraging these insights, businesses can tailor their approaches to better meet the needs and preferences of different customer groups, ultimately driving growth and customer satisfaction.
